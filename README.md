## Hosting a project using MySQL
- Depending on hosting provider you use, there can be two scenarios. 
    a. In which the provider only allows access to the database via its own machine.
    b. In which provider allows external machines also to connect to the database. 

#### PHP+MYSQL hosting
Usually, in this scenario most free hosting providers only allow to the database via their machine.
